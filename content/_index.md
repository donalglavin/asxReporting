# Introduction.
Given the cost of property in Australia combined with the continued increase in property prices. 
The barrier to entry into the property market has increased to the point that it is difficult to even own your own home 
without exposing yourself to substantial financial risk let alone owning a diversified property portfolio. 

Therefore,turning to alternative investment options such as commodities and shares presents a more realistic
 and achievable investment opportunity for retail investors to engage in.

Unfortunately, although these investment instruments have a much lower barrier to entry than property investment. 
These alternatives are already highly saturated with professional full time investment
institutions, investment banks, and trading firms all of which have significantly more money, and access to market 
information than any retail investor could ever hope for.

Consequently, It's safe to assume that your average retail investor, working in another (generally, non-financially 
focused) full time job, will never be able to compete or develop an investment strategy with an edge over the competition. 

## Objective
The primary objective of this website is therefore not, to develop the most complex and efficient investment strategy 
to compete with these institutional and full time investors; but more, to develop the most passive yet effective 
and low maintenance strategy that can achieve a reasonable, average market return whilst keeping fee's, risk and investor
supervision as low as possible but still optimise for a reasonable return on investment.

The above statement outlines the context for the remainder of the website and also defines the optimisation problem 
that the statistical models should trained against.

# Implementation & Disclaimer.

The objective of all works contained within this website are outlined as follows:
- Simplify my own personal analysis of financial data through development of a dedicated and repeatable process. 
- Showcase my technical abilities in finance, data analysis, programming, etc. for future employers.
- Play around with a bit of Machine Learning, AI and forecasting in a field that interests me.
- Keep my financial and data analysis skills current.

## Why a Website on Github? 

Because hugo pages makes web development easy and, with the help of github actions I can schedule this repository to
recompile and refresh the analyses and data more frequently that I might care to do it in my time off. 

Additionally, github will also host the website for free keeping costs down to a lovely and sustainable $0.00 AUD.
